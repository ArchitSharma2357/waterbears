The core principle of machine learning and deep learning lies in leveraging historical data to develop algorithms, such as neural networks, that identify underlying patterns within the data. These identified patterns are then utilized to make predictions about future outcomes.

Numerous approaches exist to accomplish this, and innovative methods are continually emerging in the field.

However, for the sake of simplicity, let us begin with a fundamental concept: a straight line.

We will explore how to construct a PyTorch model capable of learning the pattern of a straight line and replicating it effectively.

For now, we will focus on using this workflow to predict a simple straight line. However, the same workflow can be adapted and modified to suit different problems, allowing flexibility based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

Specifically, we will cover the following:

1. **Getting Data Ready**  
   Data can come from various sources, but to start simple, we’ll create a straightforward dataset representing a straight line.

2. **Building a Model**  
   We will design a model in PyTorch to learn patterns from the data. This step will include:
   - Selecting a suitable **loss function**.
   - Choosing an **optimizer**.
   - Constructing a **training loop** to facilitate learning.

3. **Fitting the Model to the Data (Training)**  
   With both the data and the model in place, we’ll proceed to train the model, allowing it to identify patterns within the training dataset.

4. **Making Predictions and Evaluating the Model (Inference)**  
   After training, we’ll use the model to make predictions. We’ll then compare these predictions against actual testing data to evaluate the model’s performance.

5. **Saving and Loading the Model**  
   To enable future use or further fine-tuning, we’ll cover how to save the trained model and reload it whenever needed.

6. **Putting It All Together**  
   Finally, we’ll integrate all the steps above into a cohesive workflow, demonstrating how to build, train, evaluate, save, and reuse a PyTorch model.

### Importing Required Libraries  

Before building the model, we need to import the necessary libraries and packages.  

1. **`torch`**: The core library for PyTorch, which provides tools for tensor operations and machine learning models.
2. **`torch.nn`**: A submodule of PyTorch that contains the foundational building blocks for constructing neural networks.
3. **`matplotlib.pyplot`**: A plotting library used for visualizing data and results.

We'll also check the installed version of PyTorch to ensure compatibility.

```PYTHON
# Import required libraries
import torch
from torch import nn  # nn contains all of PyTorch's building blocks for neural networks
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Check PyTorch version
torch.__version__
```

```PYTHON       
2.5.1+cu121
```
